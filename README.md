# Spout4Unity
## Important
As of January 2021 this plugin is not maintained anymore. The reason is that LightAct is phasing out support of Unity, so that we can focus better on support our Unreal Engine integration.

For the purpose of reference, we are leaving the original readme file intact below:

Spout2 support for Unity3D

This plugin allows Unity to receive and share textures from and to external softwares like Resolume, Adobe AIR, After Effects...
It has been updated to fully supports the Spout2SDK available here : https://github.com/leadedge/Spout2

This is a new repository based on the original <a href="https://github.com/benkuper/Unity-Plugins">SpoutPlugin</a> from Benjamin Kuperberg.

The components now work in play&edit mode. You can enable/disable the spout components.

Known issues: 

If you enable/disable multiple Unity senders at the same time or in a short interval you can break the connection to the texture in an external Unity receiver. 

If you change the Unity scene with the 'editor enabled' option it is possible to loose the connections to the external senders and receivers. (The plugin disable and enable itself on a scene change)
